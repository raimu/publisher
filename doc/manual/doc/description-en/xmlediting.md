How to edit the layout file
===========================

The layout file is encoded in standard XML (UTF-8) and therefore it can
be edited with any text editor
([notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org) for example). We provide a
full RelaxNG grammar which makes editing the layout XML with a good XML
editor a breeze. We know of the following editors that allow XML editing
with the support of RelaxNG. If you know of any other XML editors with
RelaxNG support, please drop us a note at
[info@speedata.de](mailto:info@speedata.de).

-   [OxygenXML](http://www.oxygenxml.com) (Mac, Windows, Linux)
-   [XMLSpy](http://www.altova.com/xml-editor/) (Windows)
-   [XML Blueprint](http://www.xmlblueprint.com/) (Windows only)
-   [GNU Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with [nxml-mode](http://www.thaiopensource.com/nxml-mode/) (all operating systems, free)
-   [jEdit](www.jedit.org) (Mac, Windows, Linux, free)

The schema for editing the layout XML can be found in the directory
`share/schema` in the file `layoutschema-en.rng`.

Note
----

The XML namespace of the layout rules is
`urn:speedata.de:2009/publisher/en`. The layout XML must look like this
if you wish to validate against the Schema:

    <Layout xmlns="urn:speedata.de:2009/publisher/en">
     ...
    </Layout>

To use layout specific functions, you should add the following namespace
declaration to the start tag:

    <Layout xmlns="urn:speedata.de:2009/publisher/en"
            xmlns:sd="urn:speedata:2009/publisher/functions/en">
     ...
    </Layout>

Replace `en` by `de` if you wish to use the German layout rules / layout
function instead of the English ones.

Connecting the RelaxNG Schema with the Layout XML in the OxygenXML editor
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

As an example, here is how to make OxygenXML automatically choose the
right Schema if you edit the layout xml file. The fastest way is to
manually connect the document to the schema:

{{ img . "oxygen-associateschema.png"}}

(You can click on any screenshot for a larger version.)

Better is to use the more persistent solution. You can associate all
documents in the namespace `urn:speedata.de:2009/publisher/en` with the
RelaxNG schema.

To do this, you need to create a new rule in “document type association”.

{{ img . "oxygen-associatedoc1.png"}}

Fill out the form as in the next screenshot:

{{ img . "oxygen-associatedoc.png"}}

and click on the `+` button to create the rule like this:

{{ img . "oxygen-associatenamespace.png"}}

After that, you need to supply the path to the RelaxNG schema file
(here: a local installation).

{{ img . "oxygen-associateschema2.png"}}

The dialog must be confirmed with `OK`. If you now open a layout XML
file, it should be automatically connected to the schema and you get
full editor support (command completion, tool tip help, validation).
